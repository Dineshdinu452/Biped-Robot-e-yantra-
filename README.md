•	Developed a self-balancing bot for National level Robotic competition conducted by IIT Bombay.
•	The robot uses sensor values provided by accelerometer and gyroscope to find exact position of itself in three- dimensional geometry and send the values to microcontroller.
•	The microcontroller uses programs in it to give proper instruction about rotation of wheels to the motor driver module which in turn helps to balance the robot
•	Wireless communication between robot and joystick is achieved by xbee module configuration.
